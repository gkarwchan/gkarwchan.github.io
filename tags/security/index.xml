      <description>A self-signed certificate is a type of SSL/TLS certificate that is generated and signed by the individual or organization that owns it, rather than being issued by a trusted Certificate Authority (CA). It is used inside development process to use https on your development server or on developer machine.&#xA;Generate self-signed :We will see how to generate self-signed certificate using:&#xA;.NET Core tool Powershell OpenSSL tool called mkcert With .NET Core tool:The .</description>

      <description>It is not exaggeration if I said, Microsoft Identity Platform is bigger than any SAS authentication provider, and if you are using Azure as your cloud provider, then the authorization benefits that will add to your application off-the-shelf, won&amp;rsquo;t be able to do it with any other platform without writing code.&#xA;Usage with .NET.NET has a library, which is considered part of the platform. It is Microsfot.Identity.Web.&#xA;How to use it?</description>

      <description>Auth0 streamlines lots of complexity for you when it comes to authenticate your SPA application.&#xA;In this article we will talk about how Single Sign ON works.&#xA;Auth0 Single Sign On and sessions:Auth0 provides Single Sign-on through the use of sessions. There are up to three different sessions:&#xA;Local session. Authorication Server session, if SSO is enabled. Identity Provider (IdP) session, if the user login through an IdP like Google, Facebook&amp;hellip;etc.</description>

      <title>Using Azure Managed Identity to skip sharing credentials</title>
      <link>https://www.ghassan.page/posts/2024_01_14_managedidentity/</link>

      <description>A common challenge for developers is the management of secrets and credentials used to secure communication between different components making up a solution. Managed identities eliminate the need for developers to manage credentials.&#xA;While developers can securely store the secrets in Azure Key Vault, services need a way to access Azure Key Vault. Managed identities provide an automatically managed identity in Microsoft Entra ID for applications to use when connecting to Azure resources.</description>

      <title>How Single Page Application call a secure your API with OAuth2</title>

      <description>When a public SPA needs to authenticate through OAuth 2.0, it faces a big challenge.&#xA;The challenge is you cannot store any type of secrets of credentials in your code. This is why OAuth provided a special flow to be used by SPA: Authorization Code Grant &amp;amp; PKCE. We are going to describe this flow in details here.&#xA;Summary of the process:To describe the flow briefly, when the SPA requires to get a token it will direct the application to an Authorization Server (AS), which will use that server login page and UI, and the user will run the login process on the AS server website, then that server will return back to the original client website using a callback url passing the token to the SPA.</description>

      <description>To add a SSL certificate to your web app hosted on Azure App Service with a custom domain, there are few options. I am going to list them here.&#xA;Free certificate:Azure provides a free SSL certificate, and it is fully managed by Azure. Azure renew the process for you, and take care of everything for you.&#xA;Although having a free certificate is a wonderful idea, but it has some shortcoming:</description>

      <description>Gone are the days when you force your users to register into your application by creating username/password. Everyone wants to skip that process when they can identify themselves using other ways (google, facebook, twitterâ€¦), and they want to use their single sign on process to identify them across multiple applications and multiple websites. In this post I am trying to explain the process and its technologies in simple English.&#xA;An explanation by example:So you are a developer who is building an application and want to allow your users to use their Google credentials to authenticate themselves into your account.</description>

      <description>You have an ARM template to deploy, and you need to pass secure parameters. Instead of storing secure values in the parameter file, you can just retrieve these values from Key Vault.&#xA;To be able to access the key vault by the resource manager you need to change access policy to allow &amp;ldquo;Azure Resource Manager for template deployment&amp;rdquo;, as shown here.&#xA;Or you can do it from Powershell:&#xA;1// to update an existing key vault 2Set-AzKeyVaultAccessPolicy -VaultName MyVaultName -EnabledForTemplateDeployment 3 4// to create a new key vault with this feature enabled 5New-AzKeyVault ` 6 -VaultName MyVaultName ` 7 -resourceGroupName myresourcegroup ` 8 -Location centralus ` 9 -EnabledForTemplateDeployment How to use it?</description>

      <description>If you have an Azure SAS token that is not working, it is good idea to parse it and understand what permissions and values it contains.&#xA;This is a JavaScript code that uses Regular Expression to parse he SAS token, and an running example where you can try your own SAS token.&#xA;1var paramNames = { 2 sig: &amp;#39;cryptographic signature&amp;#39;, 3 st: &amp;#39;start time&amp;#39;, 4 se: &amp;#39;end time&amp;#39;, 5 spr: &amp;#39;protocol&amp;#39;, 6 srt: &amp;#39;resource types&amp;#39;, 7 sv: &amp;#39;version&amp;#39;, 8 sp: &amp;#39;permissions&amp;#39;, 9 ss: &amp;#39;services&amp;#39; 10}; 11 12let valueLookups = { 13 sp : { 14 r: &amp;#39;read&amp;#39;, d: &amp;#39;delete&amp;#39;, w: &amp;#39;write&amp;#39;, l: &amp;#39;list&amp;#39;, a: &amp;#39;add&amp;#39;, 15 c: &amp;#39;create&amp;#39;, u: &amp;#39;update&amp;#39;, p: &amp;#39;process&amp;#39;, f: &amp;#39;filter&amp;#39; 16 }, 17 srt: { 18 s: &amp;#39;service&amp;#39;, c: &amp;#39;container&amp;#39;, o: &amp;#39;object&amp;#39; 19 }, 20 ss : { 21 b: &amp;#39;blob&amp;#39;, f: &amp;#39;file&amp;#39;, q: &amp;#39;queue&amp;#39;, t: &amp;#39;table&amp;#39; 22 } 23} 24 25let valueConvertor = (key, inputValue) =&amp;gt; 26 valueLookups[key] ?</description>

      <description>If your application is connecting to Azure database, or any other resources, then connecting them through Virtual Network (VNet) will enhance the performance (assuming the app service and the resources are in the same region), as well it enhance the security and we can lock the resources to have private endpoint, and not accessed publicly. I am going to go through a walk-through tutorial, using Azure Sql Server as an example, but this can work with any database on Azure, or even any resources like blob storage.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HTTP protocol specified only two standard authentication mechanisms, which are implemented in every browser, the [HTTP basic authentication]({% post_url 2016-03-31-web-security-basic-authentication %}), and the Digest authentication which is obsolete now because it is not secure anymore.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;Because they are limited and work only on user name/password idea, the development communities in every web development platform came up with their better customized solutions.&lt;br&gt;&#xA;JWT is one of the most promising and smart authentication ideas that is taking famous recently.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) and its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), are cryptographic protocols that secure internet communication by encrypting data between a client (like a browser) and a server.&#xA;How SSL/TLS works?SSL/TLS secure communication by:&#xA;Encryption: Ensures that data transmitted between the client and server cannot be read by third parties. Authentication: Verifies the identity of the server (and sometimes the client), establishing trust. Data Integrity: Guarantees that data has not been altered during transmission.</description>

      <description>All modern browsers have a built-in security policy called Same-origin policy, which help mitigate many vulnerabilities and security flaws. This policy means the browser can only pull data from the same site.&#xA;Same site means pages that share the scheme (http, ftp, https&amp;hellip;), and the host name and the port.&#xA;The clash between Same-Origin Policy and AjaxThis policy was useful for a while to protect against XSS, but with the advance of ajax, and requesting data and resources from different domains and sites, then this policy become an obstacle.</description>
